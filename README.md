Don't forget to make a virtual environment and/or install the `requirements.txt`, if you don't already have them.
# Sample outputs
![5 circles](https://github.com/cateatingpancakes/circles/blob/main/outputs/5circles.png)
This solution had 5 circles, and there seems to be space left over, so we should try more circles.

![6 circles](https://github.com/cateatingpancakes/circles/blob/main/outputs/6circles.png)
This solution has 6 circles, and it's the [optimal solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissing_number#Known_greatest_kissing_numbers) for 2D.

![7 circles](https://github.com/cateatingpancakes/circles/blob/main/outputs/7circles.png)
The solution has 7 circles, and they overlap (`cost=0.48991`), so we should remove a circle.
